Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a coder, tinkerer, and music lover currently based in Boulder, Colorado. 

## My Work

I'm interested in the design and architecture of distributed systems, cloud & virtualization, and machine learning.

I work as a software engineer at Google on the [Apigee API Platform](https://cloud.google.com/apigee-api-management/), 
part of Google Cloud. Before joining the Apigee team, I worked on the Java runtimes for Google's 
[App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/).
