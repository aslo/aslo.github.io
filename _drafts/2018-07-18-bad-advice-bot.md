## Yahoo Answers: Crowdsourced bad advice
For those unfamiliar, Yahoo Answers is a crowdsourced question and answer service that launched in 2006.
It is/was notorious for having poor quality content, bad spelling and grammar, and absurd questions.
As a result, it became known as a source of [viral memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-is-babby-formed)

in June 2014.

- Talk about how I would do it differently today?


- This was one of my first side-projects. It was
